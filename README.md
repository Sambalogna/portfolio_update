# portfolio_update

## Description

This is an update to my original Portfolio page. The site uses Bootstrap v4.5 to create a responsive layout. The navbar is responsive and switches to a toggle menu for mobile sized screens. The images and their carousels are also responsive to the webpages size. There are additional links throughout the site, starting with the navigation menu there are links to specific portions of the page as well as my GitHub. My Github is also located at the bottom of the page with the footer as well as the contact information that includes my LinkedIn, Resume and Github.
